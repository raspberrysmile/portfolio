					<p>YourSingapore.com was the portal aimed at promoting tourism in Singapore, while the BTMICE portal was aimed at promoting Singapore as the destination for business travel.</p>
					<p>The objective for this project was not only to make the portals user friendly, but also ensured the administrators could easily maintain the website.</p>
					<p>We built this site to be as modular as possible, where the clients could drag and drop and use any component they wanted to build a webpage.</p>
					<p>To keep this as light as possible, we developed our own frontend framework/design system instead of using the popular bootstrap, jQuery UI, etc.</p>
					<p>I worked with the UI designers to ensure the consistency of the UI and also closely with the backend developers to ensure the integration into AEM works as expected.</p>
