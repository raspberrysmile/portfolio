						<p>Client: Singapore Tourism Board (STB)<br>Involvement: Frontend Development for AEM Integration<br>Year: 2014, 2015<br>Agency: XM Asia Pte Ltd</p>
						<p>Skills: <span>gulp.js</span> <span>Node.js</span> <span>Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)</span> <span>Design System</span></p>
						<h3>My Involvement</h3>
						<p>The objective of this project was to make the portals user-friendly and ensure easy maintenance for administrators by developing modular components on AEM for content management and page creation.</p>
						<p>As part of the frontend team, we developed a custom frontend framework/design system to keep the codebase lean, avoiding popular libraries like Bootstrap and jQuery UI and also utilized Node.js and gulp.js for workflow automation.</p>
						<p>I collaborated closely with UI designers and backend developers to ensure seamless integration with AEM.
